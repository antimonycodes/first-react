/*
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create single-page applications and enables the development of reusable UI components.

React is not a framework but rather a frontend JavaScript library created by Facebook. It facilitates the construction of UI components, which are small, reusable sections of code containing both JavaScript and HTML. Components can include templates, logic, and are exported for reuse in other files. Examples of components include a navbar, aside, or section.

In React, components are functions that return JSX templates. JSX (JavaScript XML) allows the creation of HTML-style templates and components, and Babel converts JSX templates into HTML, rendering them to the DOM. JSX supports using `className` instead of `class` in HTML.

Styling React components can be achieved through various methods, including external stylesheets (e.g., index.css), module-based styles, inline styles, or external frameworks/preprocessors (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Sass).

State management in React involves using `useState` to handle values that may change. The initial value is set, and the corresponding setter function is used to update it, triggering a re-render.

Props (properties) are read-only properties shared between components. They allow a parent component to send data to a child component, enabling the reuse of components with unique data. PropTypes ensure the correct data types for props, and default props provide default values in case props are not passed from the parent component.

Conditional rendering in React allows the control of what gets rendered based on certain conditions. It enables showing, hiding, or changing components based on the evaluation of conditions. Conditional rendering is achieved using constructs like if statements within the JSX, allowing for dynamic content rendering.
